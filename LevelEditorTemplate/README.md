# General Approach

The general approach has us creating multiple panels that allow the user to select tiles, and place them onto a screen.

They should then be able to save, and load into that level they just edited

## TODO:

Set up the scene and resource that should help create a tilemap that references a store layout (start with basic, upgraded and fully upgraded stores).

Each should have just a base tilemap layer (so we can create boundaries via the physics layer and the tilemaps) then a size? Maybe the esize isn't necessary.

We also want to included the contents, which is what we'll allow the player to "save" on top of the base tilemap layer to create the interior store design.
