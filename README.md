# Godot Templates

## Glossary

### 1. Inventory

Basic inventory system, with pickups, quantities and class based architecture to allow for easy expansion if needed.

### 2. Vampire Survivors Template

Basic 2D plane free movement and pathing with player/mob mechanics you would expect from a Vampire Survivors-esque game. 

Includes player health, enemy health, enemy spawns, shooting, attacking aiming and basic AI logic.

### 3. 2D Tilebased Movement Template

Basic 2D plane tile based movement (think Pokemon GBA esque) where you have cardinal directional movement, with the ability to spin in place to change directions without moving (to change which direction you're facing). 

Also includes the ability to jump over ledges in one direction.
